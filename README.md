# Bash Library

This repo is a dumping ground for various *bash* functions I've built over
the years. It's in a separate repository from my normal *bash* dotfiles,
because my dotfiles contain stuff that is machine-specific and not at all
general-purpose. By contrast, these files are intended to be general-purpose,
suitable for anyone to use, if crazy enough to want to do so.
